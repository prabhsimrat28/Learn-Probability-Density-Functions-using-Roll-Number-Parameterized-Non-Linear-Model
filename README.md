# Learn-Probability-Density-Functions-using-Roll-Number-Parameterized-Non-Linear-Model
We transformed NO₂ data using a roll-number-based nonlinear function and learned a Gaussian-type probability density function for the transformed variable using maximum likelihood estimation.

1. we transformed our original variable into a new variable using non linear transformation done by using the function z.
2. The parameters used in this z function ar and br which involve usage of the roll number (102317135).
3. The sin part in z gives a non linear shift to the data
4. The function given for PDF transformation involves Gaussian Distribution so we find out it's related parameters ie mean, variance.
5. Then we tranform each point using this function and plot it's PDF.
6. We get a normal distribution
